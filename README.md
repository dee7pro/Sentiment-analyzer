# Sentiment Analysis of Flipkart Product Reviews — AI Sentiment Analyzer

Sentiment Analyzer is an end-to-end machine learning–powered sentiment analysis web application that classifies product reviews as Positive or Negative and displays a confidence score in real time. Flask was used for building a lightweight backend API, while Streamlit was used to create an interactive frontend for real-time sentiment analysis.

The project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of an ML solution — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and cloud deployment using Streamlit.

Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud : https://sentilitics.streamlit.app/
